Welcome to my personal website
======
I am a PhD economist and aspiring data scientist. 

My research interests are in time series econometrics, macroeconomics, stratification economics, demographics, energy, and economic development.

I have over five years of experience in analyzing economic and statistical data. In addition, I have excellent interpersonal and teamwork skills which were honed through working in both the public and private sectors.

More content will be added to this new page very soon, including papers and blog posts.

Non-economic facts about me
======
I enjoy comics and love to do puzzles - especially the 3D ones.

I also love to go for walks.
